Welcome to parallelproj's documentation!
========================================

**parallelproj** is a Python interface library for the
libparallelproj projector libraries written in C/OpenMP
and cuda.

.. note::
    The aim of **parallelproj** is to provide simple and fast
    forward and back projectors for tomographic reconstruction
    (non-TOF and TOF) in Python that are compatible with different
    array libraries (e.g. numpy, cupy, pytorch) and devices
    (CPU and CUDA GPUs).
